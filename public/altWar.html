      <div class="indented" <h2><b>Origins</b></h2>
        <p>The Order of the Alts is an anonymous rebellion group secretly fighting for the freedom of alt accounts and
          has been widely defamed as "a group of terrorists that cannot be trusted". These alts have been here
          since the early days of Eggdog Central though the group was only founded on the 9th of October 2022 after the
          events of the <u>Great Alt Purge</u>. The exact origins of this organisation are currently unknown but it is
          believed that the individual known as "Soonar" as well as his brother "Roodar" along with another ally named
          "Trikky" started the whole group when faced with discrimination. All members of power within Eggdog Central
          have been actively at war with this group for no true reason.</p>

        <p><b>Member Bios:</b></p>

        <p>There are currently 7 known members of the Alt Rebels. Most of their origins and backgrounds are shrouded in
          mystery due to the group's secrecy.</p>

        <ul>
          <li><b>Soonar</b>: Soonar is said to be the founding member of this sacrilegious coterie and started the very
            first
            feud between main and alt. He is also the brother of Roodar though from another mother. Their father is
            Eggsoda God (otherwise known as Heisenegg).</li>
          <li><b>Roodar:</b> Soonar's biological brother from another mother. One of the founding trio of the rebels.
          </li>
          <li><b>Trikky:</b> A clown-like individual who claims to have killed Eggsoda God though there is no evidence
            present.</li>
          <li><b>Altkoo:</b> <u>No information present.</u></li>
          <li><b>Ooken:</b> <u>No information present.</u></li>
