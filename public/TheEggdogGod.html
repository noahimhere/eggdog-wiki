  <div class="indented" <h2><b>Origins</b></h2>
    <p>From data sourced from ancient relics, fossils, landmarks, and religious practices, 
  we know that The Eggdog God was created by an evil all-powerful being known only as "The Destruction". 
  "The Destruction" created The Eggdog God to do his bidding in raining down chaos and havoc in the universe.
  This went on for centuries and millennials when Eggdog God started to become more self-aware and started to
  question what he was doing. This went on until one day, he realised the truth about his creator 
  and his intentions, so The Eggdog God rebelled against the Destruction and fled quickly to a far-away galaxy
  in the universe. From there, he did the opposite from what he was built to do. He started to create. He created
  a large planet in the centre of the galaxy he was in then made it house small, curious creatures known as "Eggdogs."
  This new species would thrive and advance in their planet rapidly but while this is happening, the Destruction also
  created his own civilisation. These creatures are known today as the infamous "Turnips" who were made to be sworn 
  enemies to the Eggdogs. The Destruction swore one day he would destroy Eggdog God and his planet, using his Turnips 
  as pieces on a chess board to wreak havoc and destruction on the Eggdogs.</p>

    <p><b>Abilities:</b></p>
    
    <p>The full extent to Eggdog God's abilities is uknown and it would be impossible to list all of his abilities.
      Eggdog God seems to exhibit unimaginable godlike abilities, some which are beyond comprehension. We know that
      he is (in mortal terms) invincible and immortal. Unscathed by any means of harm. He is also able to re-write
      reality to his desires and can fabricate anything into existence with his mind.</p>
